i need to make a calculator using only html css and javascript. the operations that the calculator should provide are addition(+), subtraction(-), division (/), multiplication(*), exponential(^). it should also be able to find square root of the displayed number when sqrt button is pressed. it should also have buttons like pie(22/7) which if pressed the number displayed should be multiplied to 22/7. It should also have a factorial button (!) which when pressed will give the factorial of the number shown on the screen. It should also have a decimal (.) option to add decimal point in numbers for calculations.
